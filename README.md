<h1>üíª About  </h1>
<p>
  The aim of the project is to create a website containing information about the capabilities of modern "Smart Houses", what may be the help in the future, and everything is achieved only by voice. It is very convenient to have a helper who is built into your house and works with voice commands. There is also a simulation that represents a smart city.

<h1>‚å®Ô∏è How it works</h1>
<p><strong>The project can be split in 3 main things :</p></strong>
<ol>
  <li>üåê Website: 
    <ul>
      <li>The website is the place where users can learn more about the project.</li>
      <li>It can also show them how to make their own smart house.</li>
      <li>Moreover, users can play the demo of the simulation directly on the website without having to download it. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>üë®‚Äçüíª Simulations:  
    <ul>
      <li>You can download the simulations from the website.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Simulation</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the simulation you can explore both a smart house and a smart city.</li>
          <li>You can monitor your house, city traffic or even talk to AI.</li>
          <li>To see more about how to play, see the <a href="">wiki</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>VR simulation</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the VR simulation, you can explore the city and the house, but in VR!</li>
          <li>You can even talk to AI with your voice!</li>
          <li>To see more about how to play, see the <a href="">wiki</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>üè† Model of a smart house : 
    <ul>
      <li>The model has several Arduino-compatible ESP 8266 modules. They are connected to the online service Adafruit, which receives and sends information to them. This information also communicates with Google Assistant.</li>
      <li>The elements we work with are transformed into objects from one house, such as the LED plays the role of a normal light bulb in the house.</li>
      <li>All components are connected to wi-fi at home or to mobile internet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
