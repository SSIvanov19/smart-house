<h1>💻 About  </h1>
<p>
  The aim of the project is to create a website containing information about the capabilities of modern "Smart Houses", what may be the help in the future, and everything is achieved only by voice. It is very convenient to have a helper who is built into your house and works with voice commands. There is also a simulation that represents a smart city.

<h1>⌨️ How it works</h1>
<p><strong>Our work can be split on 2 main things :</p></strong>
<ol>
  <li>👨‍💻 Back end : 
    <ul>
      <li>The back-end is our logic layer.</li>
      <li>It creates the mazes and rooms based on algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Front end :  
    <ul>
      <li>The front-end is our presentation layer.</li>
      <li>It controls what the used is experiencing with the program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <p>Here you can see how these two parts combines and create our project:</p>
    <ul>
